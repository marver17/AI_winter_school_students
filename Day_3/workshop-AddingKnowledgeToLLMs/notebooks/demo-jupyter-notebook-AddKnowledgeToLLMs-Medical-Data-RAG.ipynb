I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!\n",
      "ANSWER: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.\n",
      "- PATIENT MESSAGE: Last night I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like the room was spinning around. All today I have gotten the same feeling. If I move my head, stand up, lay down, anything, I feel like the room is spinning and I am extremely naseous and hot.\n",
      "ANSWER: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  It is called the vertigo, the reasons may be the infection of the internal ear, hypertension, diabetes, or some changes in the brain.  I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have an M.R.I. for confirmation.  I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms' sanitizing, and interline till the diagnosis is established.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses,sprouts, and protein rich foods to have blood, general health and resistance against infections.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.\n",
      "- PATIENT MESSAGE: Last night I was just sitting at my computer when all of the sudden I looked up and the room started spinning and I broke out in a sweat and felt nauseous.  I tried to walk to turn the air down and it was difficult.  The spinning and sweating last for about 10 minutes until I layed down on my bed till it went away.  I had the same episode about 1 month ago.  I am scared.  What could be causing this?  Also, I am a 57 year old women\n",
      "ANSWER: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your current symptoms are most likely due to peripheral vertigo. This is often due to BPPV-benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It resolves on its own in a few days. For relief of dizziness, betahistine tablets may be taken. The other condition to exclude would be posterior circulation ischemia (lack of blood flow to the back of brain). This is more likely if you have risk factors such as diabetes, high BP or cholesterol. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/\n"

    "1. Convert both the generated answer and reference answer into vector embeddings using a SentenceTransformers model.\n",
